{"name":"Brackets-ternifico","tagline":"Javascript hinting with tern in Brackets.","body":"Ternifico\r\n=============\r\n\r\n[Tern](http://ternjs.net/) integration with brackets.<br>\r\n\r\n1. Integration with brackets' native hint manager system.\r\n2. Run Tern as a server or integrated instance, which runs in a web worker.  Soon to come, ability to fire up a tern server from the UI.\r\n3. Per folder/project .tern-project.  Ternific will traverse the directory structure looking for the first available  .tern-project file. If no .tern-project is found, then a default .tern-project is loaded.\r\n4. Live reload of .tern-project.  So, saving changes will automatically take effect without reloading Brackets. [Only for integrated tern and not for servers yet].\r\n5. Support for Meteor plugin!  Thanks to Slava for https://github.com/Slava/tern-meteor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n=============\r\n1. Where is the default .tern-project?<br>\r\n  Default .tern-project can be found in tern/.tern-project in ternific installation directory.\r\n2. How do I add node or meteor support?<br>\r\n  Node and meteor are loaded as plugins.  You need to add the correspoding entries to the plugins section in .tern-project.  You can use https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Ternific/blob/master/.tern-project as a template or just use the default .tern-project in tern's directory.\r\n3. Why isn't the default .tern-project file not live reloading.<br>\r\n  Live reload is only supported for project specific .tern-project.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n=============\r\n\r\nCompleting an Array...\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David5i6/wiki/master/ternifico/images/Brackets_tern_Array.png)\r\n\r\nWorking with functions...\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David5i6/wiki/master/ternifico/images/Brackets_tern_function.png)\r\n\r\nWhat can I do with a String ? ...\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David5i6/wiki/master/ternifico/images/Brackets_tern_string.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit\r\n=============\r\n\r\n1. Brackets' javascript hinting has been used and code has been lifted and integrated into this extension.<br>\r\n2. Code has been taken from tern demo.js in order to make tern integration possible.<br>\r\n3. Original Ternific By Miguel del Castillo (this is a fork).<br>\r\n4.
