Brackets-Tern
=============

Tern integration with brackets.  This is in early development stages, so I have not added the full feature set from tern or all brackets' hinting capabilities...<br><br>
Some bullet items are:

1. Integration with brackets' native hint manager system. So installing this extension will allow you to use tern as the hint provider instead of brackets' native js hint engine.
2. The code is setup to handle either remote tern server or directly loaded in brackets; this is ony switchable at code level and it is not a runtime setting.


How to
=============

* Install... Open Brackets then copy and paste https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Tern into File->Install Extension.  You don't need to restart Brackets.


Credit
=============

1. Brackets' javascript hinting has been used and code has been lifted and integrated into this extension.<br>
2. Code has been taken from tern demo.js in order to make tern integration possible.<br>
