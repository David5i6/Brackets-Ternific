Brackets-Tern
=============

[Tern](http://ternjs.net/) integration with brackets.<br><br>
Some bullet items are:

1. Integration with brackets' native hint manager system. So installing this extension will allow you to use tern as the hint provider instead of brackets' native js hint engine.
2. The code is setup to handle either remote tern server or directly loaded in brackets; this is ony switchable at code level and it is not a runtime setting.
